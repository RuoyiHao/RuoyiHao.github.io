I received my B.E. degree in Process Equipment and Control Engineering from the East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China, in 2020. I am currently a 3rd Ph.D. student at [Medical Mechatronics Lab](http://www.labren.org/mm/) of the [Department of Electronic Engineering](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/), supervised by [Prof. Hongliang Ren](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/people/academic-staff/professors/prof-ren-hongliang).

My research interests include medical robot systems, robot perception, and autonomous control.
